Well this is my first addon i intend to share, there may be bugs and i cant guarrentee il be able to fix them.

i have a feeling that if you managed to get this you know how to install it but just in case...
1. checkout the svn
2. place the folder you checked out into your gmod addons folder, if you dont know where that is your beyond my help.
3. update it whenever you want to, if these steps challange you im not able to help you.
